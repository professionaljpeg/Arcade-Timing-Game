# Arcade-Timing-Game

# Description & Rules
This is a pretty simple game, wherein a white LED spins around each LED, and if you press either button on the green/yellow LED's, you gain 2 points on the green, 1 point on the yellow. If you press the button when the white LED is on the Red LED's, you lose a life. You have three lives, if you run out of lives, the game restarts. The switch pauses the game, and you can pause in the middle of a game if you so desire. Every two points, the speed the LED rotates around the LED's gets faster and faster.
