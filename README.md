# Simon-Says-Wario-Ware-Game

# Description & Rules
I’ve decided to go with a Warioware-esque/bop-it design of a bunch of minimalistic games with simple objectives which would keep repeating until you’ve run out of lives. You have a certain amount of time to complete each objective given, and as you keep winning, the time needed to complete each objective gets shorter and shorter, which will add a sense of urgency and give a competitive edge to the game. There's a points system, and it would be based on the amount of minigames completed within the three lives. The farther you get into the game, the more points are earned per minigame, in order to reward the player for completing challenges.
